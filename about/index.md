<h2 class="title text-center">whoami</h2>

Hello my name is Khoa.
I'm 20 years old.

I'm a 3rd year Bachelor student in Ecole Polytechnique, France.
I'm currently pursuing a double major in Mathematics and Computer Science.

I'm interested in networking, cybersecurity and system administration stuff.

I also do competitive programming for fun sometimes.
I participated and got top 19 in Southwestern Europe regional of ACM-ICPC 18-19.

Favourite song: [Requiem - Mallory Bechtel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yrl1qEyqfcI)

Favourite singer: [Against The Current](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCxMsgwldMZiuFTD6jjv32yQ)

About this blog, I want to use it both as personal documentation on various topics (ComSci related mostly), as well as educational resources for friends/other students in the field. It might serve as general FAQ or some cool/inspirational ideas to try out

Getting in touch with me if you have questions or just wanna chat.
