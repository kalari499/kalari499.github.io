<h2 class="title text-center">bash -c "whoami"</h2>

<p>Hello my name is Khoa. I'm 20 years old.</p>
<p>I'm a 3rd year Bachelor student in Ecole Polytechnique, France. I'm doing a double major in Math and Computer Science.</p>
<p>I'm interested in network/security stuff. I'm ranked Pro Hacker (cool title I know) on [hackthebox.eu](https://www.hackthebox.eu) with around 40 rooted machines under my belt. I also do several CTFs for fun as well but not with any teams.</p>

<p>Aside from that, I also do Competitive Programming. I participated in ACM-ICPC 2018, regional round of South Western Europe (top 19)</p>

<br/>

<p>I enjoy coding in my free time. Experience with Bash/Python/Perl/Ruby (scripting) and C/C++/ASM (binary reversing/exploiting). Also experience with algorithmic/game theory stuff.</p>
<p>I also enjoy cooking if the timetable allows it. Big fan of Gordon Ramsay, both as a chef and a person.</p>
<p>Favorite song: [Requiem - Mallory Bechtel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yrl1qEyqfcI)</p>
<p>Favorite singer: [Against The Current](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCxMsgwldMZiuFTD6jjv32yQ)</p>

<br/>

<p>About this website/blog, I want to use it both as personal documentation on various topics (ComSci related mostly), as well as educational resources for friends/other students in the field. It might serve as general FAQ or some cool/inspirational ideas to try out.</p>

<br/>

<p>Getting in touch with me if you have questions or just wanna chat.</p>
