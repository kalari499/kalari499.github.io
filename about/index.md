Hello my name is Khoa.
I'm 20 years old.

I'm a 3rd year Bachelor student in Ecole Polytechnique, France.
I'm pursuing a double major in Mathematics and Computer Science.

I'm interested in networking, cybersecurity and system administration stuff.
I want to be a red team pentester in the future.
Either that or maybe I can be a sysadmin or devops I don't know we will see about that in few years.

For daily work, I use mostly Linux, either Debian/Ubuntu or Arch derivatives, maybe a bit of CentOS.
I can do a bit of troubleshooting basic problem with computer (not printer) or network.
I'm also quite decent at searching Google and StackOverflow.
Don't hesitate to give me a DM if you need my help with problems like Wifi not working, why Python code is complaining or dual-booting Linux with Windows to try out.

I'm semi-active on Hack The Box and CTF community in general.
I have worked with and exploited several common basic vulnerabilities.

I also do competitive programming for fun sometimes.
I participated and got top 19 in Southwestern Europe regional of ACM-ICPC 18-19.

Some random non-technical stuffs that nobody asks for:
- Language: Vietnamese (mother tongue), English (fluent), French (meh but can listen to normal conversation)
- Want to visit Scandinavian area and learn Swedish in the future
- Favourite song: [Requiem - Mallory Bechtel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yrl1qEyqfcI)
- Favourite singer: [Against The Current](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCxMsgwldMZiuFTD6jjv32yQ)
