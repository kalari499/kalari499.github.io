title: Let's build a home server (part 2)

### Base setup

First thing I need to do before building the actual home server is create multiple machines.
Since I'm not using Puppet or anything for unattended instsall, I'm going to do it semi-automatically.

First, I create a base machine (Debian-base) as a template then clone it multiple times.

#### Installation

Debian-base will have 256MB RAM with 30GB disk.
The amount of RAM can always be change later after cloning anyway.
I choose Debian because it can run with memory as low as 128MB.

The actual installation is straightforward.
Most settings can be kept default.
In addition, I choose to install only system standard utilities and SSH server for management reasons.

After initial installation, login as root, update the server with 
```
apt-get update && apt-get upgrade
```
to keep the system up-to-date after a fresh installation.

Also install tools like
```
apt-get install curl tcpdump
```
for debugging later.

Optionally install sudo with
```
apt-get install sudo
```
because Debian netinstall doesn't have it by default.
I need it because then I can create an administrative user to SSH (Enable SSH as root is not recommended).

#### Cloning

First disable all the interfaces before cloning.
Change all MAC addresses to not confuse gateway/DHCP server later.
Also change machine hostname by manually editting `/etc/hosts` and `/etc/hostname`.
Of course change root password as well.

**Note**: `hostnamectl` does not change `/etc/hosts` by default.
