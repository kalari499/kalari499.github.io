### Bravo

After installing DNS server, I need a gateway to route all outbound traffics through.
Later I can install a firewall for filtering and logging.

#### Configure Alpha

Bravo needs 2 network interfaces: 1 for internal network (enp0s3) and 1 for outbound internet (enp0s8).

First I need to configure Alpha for 2 things: Add upstream DNS servers and specify Bravo to be the gateway.

Add upstream DNS servers in `/etc/dnsmasq`.
```
server=<DNS server>
server=<DNS server>
```

Add default gateway in `/etc/dnsmasq`.
```
dhcp-option=option:router,172.16.12.2
```

Also set default routing for Alpha itself
```
ip route add default via 172.16.12.2 dev enp0s3
```

#### Setup routing tables

In this setup Bravo default route is through enp0s3, which doesn't have any Internet.
I need to change that so Bravo default route is through enp0s8.
```
ip route del default via 172.16.12.2 dev enp0s3
ip route add default via <local gateway> dev enp0s8
```
Bravo itself should have Internet now but no DNS resolve because Alpha hasn't had Internet yet.

Now I need to turn Bravo into a NAT router by setting up some firewall rules.

Enable package forwarding on Bravo.
```
echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward
```

Setup NAT routing.
```
iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -o enp0s8 -j MASQUERADE
```

Accept traffic from enp0s3.
```
iptables -A INPUT -i enp0s3 -j ACCEPT
```

Accept traffic from enp0s8 but only established traffic.
```
iptables -A INPUT -i enp0s8 -m state --state ESTABLISHED,RELATED -j ACCEPT
```

#### Testing

`ping example.com` should work because both DNS server and gateway work.

#### Notes

For now there is no "traffic control" yet, which means all machine can route through this one.
To whitelist/blacklist machines, add more iptables rules.
