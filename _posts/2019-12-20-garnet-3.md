title: Let's build a home server (part 3)

### Alpha

In previous parts, I have created a bunch of machines to work with.
First I need a DNS and DHCP server for the whole subnet.

#### Installation

First I need to temporarily enable an additional bridge interface for installing software.
Later another machine will handle the routing part.

The DHCP server I'm using here is dnsmasq because it's simple to use and does its job well.
Install with
```
apt-get install dnsmasq
```
Now I can disable the bridge interface.

#### Configuration

My subnet is going to be 172.16.12.0/24 and domain name `.garnet`.
So `/etc/dnsmasq.conf` looks like this
```
domain-needed
bogus-priv
expand-hosts
domain=garnet
local=/garnet/
interface=enp0s3
listen-address=172.16.12.1

dhcp-range=172.16.12.50,172.16.12.245
dhcp-host=<MAC address>,172.16.12.1,infinite
dhcp-host=<MAC address>,172.16.12.2,infinite
dhcp-host=<MAC address>,172.16.12.3,infinite
```

as well as `/etc/hosts`
```
172.16.12.1   alpha.garnet
172.16.12.2   bravo.garnet
172.16.12.3   charlie.garnet
```

and `/etc/resolv.conf`.
```
domain garnet
search garnet
nameserver 172.16.12.1
```

If I need to add more static routes then I need to add to both files and restart.

Finally I need to setup the IP and restart the DNS/DHCP server.
```
ip link set dev enp0s3 up
ip address add dev enp0s3 172.16.12.1/24 brd 172.16.12.255

systemctl restart dnsmasq
```

#### Testing

`host bravo.garnet` should work.

#### Notes

For now Alpha can only resolve local DNS requests (defined in `/etc/hosts` to be exact).
Later I need to add default gateway as well as upstream servers after installing gateway.
