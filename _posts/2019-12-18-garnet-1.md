title: Let's build a home server (part 1)

### Introduction

I have a spare laptop laying around the house not doing anything.
It's kinda an average laptop with 1TB drive with 4GB RAM, nothing too fancy.
So I thought it would be nice to turn it into a home server, for practicing sysadmin stuff.
It's holiday time right ?

Instead of running 10 different services on the same computer, I'm using virtualization to create multiple machines, each for a different job.
The laptop is not very strong so I have to be very careful with memory management of the servers.

### Hypervisor

For the main operating system, I'm using latest Debian stable, or Debian Buster.
In fact most of the VMs in the server would be in Debian, with some exception like the firewall, to save memory.
But of course CentOS or FreeBSD should work as well.

Here I'm using VirtualBox for the virtualization instead of qemu+kvm because it's just easier to work with.
To install, download the .deb package from [here](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads) and install with
```
sudo apt-get install ./virtualbox-6.1_6.1.0-xxxxxx-Debian~buster_amd64.deb
```

**Note**: Use `apt` to install instead of `dpkg` because it can pull all dependencies for you, also you can remove/purge that package later with `apt`.

### Planning

First thing first, I need a naming scheme for the network.
I'm not very creative with names, but luckily there is a website that can help me with that: [namingschemes.com](https://namingschemes.com/)
I end up naming my cluster by NATO alphabet.
You know what, in the end I might be able to remember the NATO alphabet, as a side benefit.

For now everything is going to stay inside an internal network, and I'm setting my hypervisor to be a proxy server so I can update and download stuff.

I don't know how the server is going to be yet but I'm excited.
Let's see.
