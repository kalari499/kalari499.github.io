title: Tips&#58; Choosing Linux distro for beginners
description: My thoughts and suggestions on choosing your next (or first) Linux distro for beginners.

### Context

I have been distro-hopping for quite a while.
Basically I tried around 20-30 common distros out there, in order to find the one that fits me the most.
Each distro aims for different audiences, and has different advantages/disadvantages.

With that being said, here are my thoughts on how to pick your next Linux distro, whether you are a beginner looking to change to Linux or just looking for a new beginner-friendly distro to try.

Disclaimer: Most pictures here I take from the Internet because I don't keep most distros around to screenshot anymore.
However I can assure you that they would have the same looks and vibes from the pictures.

### Judge on which criteria ?

My criteria for a beginner distro is very simple
- Does it look nice and pleasant ? Obviously because nobody wants to work with ugly interfaces from 1990
- Does it loaded with necessary drivers and utilities ? Nobody should have to download firmware ucode for Wifi support directly
- Can an user work with the distro immediately out of the box without configuration ? Most people just want to install it and move on with their common workflow without configuration too much, maybe aside from wallpaper
- Can an user update and install new apps without knowing anything about the terminal ? Users shouldn't have to learn what is *apt-get something something* to install stuff

As a sidenote, I only state my top 3 here because the more choices we have, the harder we can decide.
All 3 distros here are perfect for daily usage, with minimal differences between each others.

#### Kubuntu - KDE Plasma

Probably the most suggested distro in the Linux community - Ubuntu.
Kubuntu is actually a derivative of original Ubuntu, but still counted as an official release.
The only different is Kubuntu uses KDE as the desktop environement, while Ubuntu uses GNOME.
- Why using Kubuntu ?
    + KDE is a full-featured desktop, with a lot of amazing tools and very customizable
    + Huge commuity and forum online. You can pretty Google every possible error and problems you have
    + A huge list of available software to install from Ubuntu Software Center
- What can be drawbacks ?
    + KDE might be heavy on storage and take more RAM (side effect of having a lot of tools)
- I would recommend Kubuntu especially for
    + Programmers (and CS students in general)
    + People who want a fully-equipped set of tools

#### Linux Mint - Cinnamon

A derivative of classic Ubuntu, aiming specially for beginners, featuring a homebrew classic and minimal Cinnamon desktop.
- Why using Linux Mint ?
    + Cinnamon is very lean and clean, not heavy on resources. Share similar vibe to Windows XP/7 but much more beautiful
    + Aiming directly for beginners so very user-friendly with a lot of support
    + A derivative of Ubuntu so it also can access to huge list of available softwares from Ubuntu
- What can be drawbacks ?
    + No security advisory, need to use terminal to install updates
- I would recommend Linux Mint especially for
    + Windows users
    + People who want a light, simple and minimal style

#### ElementaryOS - Pantheon

Another derivative of class Ubuntu, aiming specially for beginners, featuring a homebrew elegant Pantheon desktop.
A new born in the community.
- Why using ElementaryOS ?
    + Pantheon is very elegant, probably the most elegant desktop out there in the Linux community. I mean they literally have [official Human Interface Guidelines](https://elementary.io/docs/human-interface-guidelines)
    + Very similar vibe to Apple MacOS style, but doesn't require you to buy overpriced hardware
    + Also being a derivative of Ubuntu so it can do everything Ubuntu can, and has everything Ubuntu has
- What can be drawbacks ?
    + Not very customizable (but who needs customizable when it's already beautiful)
- I would recommend ElementaryOS for
    + MacOS users
    + People who want an elegant style

### Ending

Personally I would go for Linux Mint just because its simplicity.
Fun fact, do you know Elliot in Mr Robot also uses Linux Mint for daily driver ?
