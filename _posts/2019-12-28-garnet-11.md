### Hotel

Nginx is an alternative to Apache, kind of like Debian vs CentOS.
I want to get more comfortable with both servers.

#### Installation

Install 3 things: Apache, PHP support (php-fpm\*) and PostgreSQL client
```
apt-get install nginx php-fpm postgresql-client
```

The server should be running automatically with PHP support, otherwise just run it manually
```
systemctl restart nginx
```

Here are some snippets for configurating Nginx.
The config files are quite straightforward.

#### Virtual Host Routing

Host multiple sites on the same machines.

Snippet
```
server {
  listen 80 default_server
  listen [::]:80 default_sevrver ;

  root "/var/www/site1";
  index index.php index.html;

  server_name site1.hotel.garnet;

  location / {
    try_files $uri $uri/ =404;
  }

  location ~ \.php$ {
    include snippets/fastcgi-php.conf;
    fastcgi_pass unix:/run/php/php7.3-fpm.sock;
  }
  
  location ~ /\.ht {
    deny all;
  }
}
```

To enable the site.
```
ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/site1 /etc/ngnx/sites-enabled/site1
systemctl restart nginx
```

#### HTTPS support

Snippet
```
  listen              443 ssl;
  ssl_certificate     "/path/to/server/certificate";
  ssl_certificate_key "/path/to/server/key";
```

#### Reverse Proxy

Reverse proxy is like your mail box.

Snippet
```
location / {
  proxy_pass        "http://backend-server";
  proxy_set_header  Host $host;
}
```

**Note**: If `proxy_set_header` is not set then Nginx keeps the Host header by default.

#### Forward Proxy

Forward proxy is like your local mail office.

Snippet
```
location / {
  proxy_pass        "http://$http_host$uri$is_args$args;
}
```

#### Caching Server

Don't overload the backend server.

Snippet
```
http {
  proxy_cache_path  "/var/cache/nginx" levels=1:2 use_temp_path=off;

  server {
    location / {
      proxy_cache
      proxy_pass        "http://backend-server";
    }
  }
}
```

**Note**: Same as Apache, ached response would be hashed by URL, example to "ABCDEFG.
Then it would be stored in A/B/CDEFG with levels=1:2.
