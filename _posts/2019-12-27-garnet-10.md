### Golf

It takes me only 10 posts before I could install my webserver to practice my sick webdev skills.
So I'm gonna go apeshit and install both Apache and Nginx.

For real though it think it would be important to practice installing and basic configuring webservers.
Golf is the first one: Apache server.

#### Installation

Install 3 things: Apache, PHP support (libapache2-mod-php\*) and PostgreSQL client
```
apt-get install apache2 php postgresql-common
```

The server should be running automatically with PHP support, otherwise just run it manually
```
systemctl restart apache2
```

Here are some snippets for configurating Apache.
The config files are quite strightforward.

#### Virtual Host Routing

Host multiple sites on the same machines.

Snippet
```
<VirtualHost *:80>
  DocumentRoot "/var/www/site1"
  ServerNames site1.foxtrot.garnet

  ErrorLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/error.log
  CustomLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/access.log combined
</VirtualHost>
```

To enable the site.
```
a2ensite site1.conf
systemctl restart apache2
```

#### HTTPS support

Prequisite: Enable module `mod_ssl`.
```
a2enmod ssl
```

Snippet
```
  SSLEngine On
  SSLCertificateFile    "/path/to/server/certificate"
  SSLCertificateKeyFile "/path/to/server/key"
```

#### Reverse Proxy

Reverse proxy is like your mail box.

Prequisite: Enable module `mod_proxy` and `mod_proxy_http`.
```
a2enmod proxy
a2enmod proxy_http
```

Snippet
```
  ProxyPass         "/" "http://backend-server"
  ProxyPassReverse  "/" "http://backend-server"
  ProxyPreserveHost On 
```

**Note**: `ProxyPreserveHost On` keeps the Host header, normally only needed for virtual host routing, else can turn off.

#### Forward Proxy

Forward proxy is like your local mail office.

Prequisite: Enable module `mod_proxy` and `mod_proxy_http`.
```
a2enmod proxy
a2enmod proxy_http
```

Snippet
```
ProxyRequests On
ProxyVia On

<Proxy "*">
  Require host "backend-server" # Can be Require ip instead of Require host
</Proxy>
```

#### Caching Server

Don't overload the backend server.

Prequisite: Enable module `cache` and `cache_disk`.
```
a2enmod cache
a2enmod cache_disk
```

Snippet
```
  CacheRoot       "/var/cache/apache2"
  CacheEnable     disk  / # Can be http://backend-server for caching forward proxy traffic only
  CacheDirLevels  2
  CacheDirLength  1
```

**Note**: Cached response would be hashed by URL, example to "ABCDEFG" (length 22).
Then it would be stored in A/B/CDEFG with CacheDirLevels 2 and CacheDirLength 1.
