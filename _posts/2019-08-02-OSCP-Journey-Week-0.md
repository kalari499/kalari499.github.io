### TLDR

I sign up for OSCP today for 30 days lab. Just quick general thought and plan for the following weeks.

### Story Time

3 months ago, I registered for an account on [HackTheBox](https://www.hackthebox.eu/).
My relevant background at that point was basically a introductory course to Networking, and some basic Linux experience (I was using Ubuntu 99% of the time but not administrative stuff).

I was hooked to the initial HTB invite code challenge, solved it quite fast on my own.
But then I realized I didn't know anything the moment I touched all boxes, even the easiest one at that point (Netmon).
Fortunately school was quite manageable and I got a lot of free times so I thought to myself "Why not, I like challenges ?"

Things were really hard initially.
I didn't know what keywords to Google and I got nobody to ask when I faced a wall.
I managed to root Netmon after 1 week.
To me it felt like one of the best feeling ever, a validation for my effort.

I started doing more and more.
I've learnt a lot through the process
I found the fun in stucking, rabbit holes and failure attempts.
I could spend hours doing it and I believed I could see myself doing it as a career.

At some point of time I read about OSCP and I wanted to test myself with it.
Money was kinda a big problem for me ($1000 is no joke), so I tried to do HTB as much as possible until I feel ready.
Finally after reaching Pro Hacker rank last week with around 35 boxes rooted, I bite the bullet today and sign up for the OSCP course/exam for 30 days, starting on August 11th.

### Why 30 days ?

I like challenges.
I have quite a lot of free time because the school year starts, which means I can spend more hours per day in Offsec lab.
At least that's what I hope.
Money also plays a factor here.
Also if I fail on my first exam attempt, I could buy an extension and get another exam attempt for free.

### What to expect from this series ?

This series is meant to be my personal document on my OSCP journey, regardless of success or failure.
I would write a recap post at the end of each week to summarize what I have finished, what I could have done better and general thoughts on the week.

### What now ?

I have like 1 week before my lab time starts (hence week 0). My plan for this week would be doing a bunch of old and easy HTB boxes that people recommend. I might take a look at the famous [abatchy's post](https://www.abatchy.com/2017/02/oscp-like-vulnhub-vms.html) about vulnhub boxes for practicing.
 
That's it for this week. See you all next week.
